# Library Catalog

## Project Description

This project is an application for creating and managing a library catalog that can contain books, newspapers, and almanacs (collections of works by several authors). 

For a book, we should have the author of the book, the title of the book, the genre, and the number of pages. 

For a newspaper, we should have the name of the newspaper, the date of the newspaper issue, and the list of the main headlines of the newspaper. 

For an almanac, we should have the name of the almanac and the list of works (books) that are printed in it. 

Develop an interface class with the necessary list of virtual abstract methods. 

For the catalog, provide the possibility of test initialization, output of the entire catalog to the screen, search by book or newspaper title, search by author.

It should be possible to save the catalog to a file and restore the catalog from a file.
